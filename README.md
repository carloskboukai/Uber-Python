# Uber-Python

Uber Technologies, Inc. provides ride-hailing services that operates through an app. Although it is very popular, the company has struggled with the constant rising costs of fuel and living. They think they should increase their price, but they are afraid of driving away customers with this measure. They want to uncover more information about their customers’ behaviour. 
My task is to perform an initial  exploratory analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for informed decision-making.  Uber stakeholders are most interested in the busiest hours and days, most popular locations and number of passengers per trip. 

# Data

> The contents of this project were organised as follows:
1. Project brief - this folder contains the stakeholders brief and business questions that drive the analysis.
2. Data - this folder contains two folders: one for the original data sets, and one for the wrangled and prepared data sets. NOTE: this folder was not uploaded with the rest of the file.
3. Scripts - this folder contains all the notebooks, including the codes necessary to assess, clean and organise, wrangle and analysie the data. Also includes the coding necessary to create the visualisations for the final report.
4. Visualisations - this folder contains all the visualisations obtained in the 'scripts' folder, which were included in the final report. It is divided between graphic elements and maps.
